TEAM PPTG

We will look at US Spending by department and:

- create a dynamic map which adjusts based on a users selection
- shows the speding amount by state and potentially other districts
- we are using the API on usaspending.gov as our source
- We will use Flask to render our html and handle the database management of the data
